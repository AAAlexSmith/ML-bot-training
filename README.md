###Training a robot using machine learning to walk

###Here I will be uploading the code for my Machine Learning robot training project, here is a brief description about it:
This project takes a robot, with no instructions on how to move, and trains it using Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning) based on camera data (the robots vision) and 3d positional data as inputs. The robot is 'rewarded' based on progress its made from its home position (x=0,y=0,z=0). The outputs of the Machine Learning algorithm are servo motor movements.

The robot is placed in the center of a 'playing field' and its cables run up and through the head of a CNC rig, which surrounds the playing field. When a 'trial' begins the robot will have a certain amount of time to move as far as possible. When the trial ends the robot stops, and is pulled up by its cables by a motorized spool and relocated to its home position by the CNC rig. The next trial starts immeadiatly after, no requiring any human input, thus allowing the system to run 24/7.

The robots 3d position is tracked using a HTC Vive Tracker on the robot and two HTC Vive Base Stations on opposite corners of the CNC rig...TO BE UPDATED...
